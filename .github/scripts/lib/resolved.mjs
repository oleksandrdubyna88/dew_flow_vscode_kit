// lib/resolved.mjs — where a program actually is, for every script in `.github/scripts/`.
//
// Its own module since 2026-09-26: it lived inside `branch-protection.mjs`, and once the release
// scripts (`release-anchors.mjs`, `docs-only-title.mjs`) needed it too, importing a PATH resolver from
// a branch-protection script coupled two things that have nothing to do with each other. Nothing about
// it changed in the move. Its edge cases are held by `branch-protection.mjs --selftest`, and the module on
// its own by `pathResolver.test.ts` (dew_flow_connect_other_ais) and `tools/branch-protection-resolver.test.mjs`
// (dew_flow_conventions), each on a PATH the test controls.

/**
 * Where a program actually is, resolved once, rather than a bare name handed to the spawner.
 *
 * <p>Spawning `gh` by name delegates the choice of what runs to whatever `PATH` happens to say —
 * SonarCloud calls it out (S4036) and it is right that the decision should be visible. Resolving it
 * here does not make PATH trustworthy; what it buys is that the lookup is one explicit step with an
 * error somebody can act on, instead of an opaque spawn failure at the moment the tool was supposed
 * to answer a question.</p>
 *
 * <p>Done in JavaScript rather than by shelling out to `which`, because `which` would be the same
 * problem one level down.</p>

  // entry like any other. So this refuses the IMPLICIT form — a typo, a trailing colon, a PATH
